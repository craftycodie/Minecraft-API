<h1>The MineOnline Launcher</h1>
MineOnline is a no nonsense pre-release launcher that does all of the heavy lifting for you. <br/>
Simply register, login, give it a jar, and it'll do the rest.<br/>

<h1>Like Brand New</h1>
With the MineOnline API, <b>everything</b> has been restored. You can change your skin and cloak, join servers in online mode, you can even save maps online. <br/> <br/>
The old web applets now run buttery smooth as desktop games with the features you'd expect from a standalone, like fullscreening, resizing and screenshotting; the launcher just adds those features in with no mods at all!<br/>

<h1>Discord and Minecraft Servers</h1>
Along with this project I am hosting a beta 1.7.3 server and with various pre-alpha servers from time to time.
If you are interested in joining, testing, or just following the project, <a href="https://discord.gg/RBKKnxf">join our discord server!</a><br/><br/>
